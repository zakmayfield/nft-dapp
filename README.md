# DApp template by AboveSnakes.eth

## A dApp template created in React that just needs minor changes
### âœ… Run these commands:

- `npm install`

- `npm start`

### âœ… Replace contract specific data such as 
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- `CHAIN_REQUIRED`
- Project Info

### âœ… Install MetaMask extension
- This dApp currently only works with MetaMask, please install MetaMask to continue with minting

---
```Be sure to view the console and watch the logs as you fire up the app and go through the process of minting. It's detailed enough to pinpoint where MetaMask errors may occur.```

---
After the above steps are finished the project should be connected to the specified deployed contract and is ready for minting. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This dApp can be placed in any front end react app as a card, or a whole page, your choice.

Feel free to update styling, and make it your own.
